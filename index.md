# Who am I?

---

# Co-lead of the Rust language design team

???

I imagine most of you know me from this role.

---

# Senior Principal Engineer at Amazon

---

# What hats am I wearing now?

--

None of those!

---

# Current focus

## Rust vision doc goal

---

# What is the vision doc?

Attempting to answer the question:

*What comes next for Rust?*

---

# It begins with data

Capture feedback from Rust users, maintainers, and adopters 

What is working well? What could be better?

What big picture goals should Rust pursue to move the needle?

---

# Synthesizing

Read through the data, identify themes

---

# Expected result

## About Rust

* "What is Rust's mission?"
* "What do people value most in Rust? When do they choose to use Rust and why?"
* "What would help Rust to succeed in domain X?"
* "What would help Rust to succeed in area X?"

--

## About how we build Rust

* "How can we tap into the knowledge, experience, and enthusiasm of a growing Rust userbase to improve Rust?"
* "How can we make contributing to Rust **joyful?**"
well-supported?"

---

# What is Rust's *mission*

It's time for us to think beyond "adoption"

---

# What is Rust *for*?

* Async systems?
* CLI tools?
* Embedded development?
* Web sites?
* Bash scripts?

---

# What is Rust *for*?

My take: **[Foundational software][]**

[Foundational software]: https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2025/03/10/rust-2025-intro/

---

# What foundational software needs to be

* Reliable and secure: **if it compiles, it works**
* Performant: **zero-cost abstractions**, **fearless concurrency**
* Stable: **stability without stagnation**
* Low-level control: **TBD** (1)

.footnote[
    (1) We...don't have an establish slogan for this. I tend to think "**no limits**" in my head.
]

---

# What foundational software SHOULD NOT be

* Inaccessible and obscure

---

# Thinking beyond adoption

What is Rust's *mission*?

*Foundational software for everyone*

---

# Why the vision doc?

## To help us have some needed conversations

---

# Wearing my Amazon hat...

## Rust application domains

* At-scale network services in AWS
* Consumer devices

--

## Memory safety is a key enabler

Amazon bet big on Java and it paid off

--

## Ecosystem is great but...

* Rising regulatory requirements
* Single-maintainer crates
* Upgrades make me nervous

---

# Main groups

* Individual Rust users

--
* Global Rust communities

--
* Rust maintainers

--
* **Companies adopting or considering Rust**

---

# What I want to hear from you

* Your company's journey to Rust (or not).
* Describe your experiences onboarding folks to Rust.
* What have you used Rust for? What worked well?
* Where have you found Rust does not work well?
* What concerns do you hear about using Rust?

---

# How we work

* Interviews, 30-45 minutes
* No wrong answers

---
