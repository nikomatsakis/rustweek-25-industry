# Who am I?

---

# Co-lead of the Rust language design team

???

I imagine most of you know me from this role.

---

# Senior Principal Engineer at Amazon

---

# What hats am I wearing now?

None of those!

---

# Co-lead of the Rust vision doc goal

---

# What is the vision doc?

Capture feedback from Rust users, maintainers, and adopters 

What is working well? What could be better?

What big picture goals should Rust pursue to move the needle?

---

# What is Rust *for*?

* Async systems?
* CLI tools?
* Embedded development?
* Web sites?
* Bash scripts?

---

# My take

## *oundational* systems

---

# Why the vision doc?

## It's time for us to think beyond "adoption"

---

# Why the vision doc?

## To help us have some needed conversations




---

# Code example

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world");
}
```
